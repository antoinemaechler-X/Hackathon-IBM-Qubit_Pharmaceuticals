This is the code we used for a hackaton organized in January 2025 by Margo, IBM and Qubit Pharmaceuticals.
During 48 hours, we had to predict molecular toxicity of some molecules based on their smiles chain and other molecular features.
Using GNN's, we represented molecular geometry and adapted the DeepHit model.
