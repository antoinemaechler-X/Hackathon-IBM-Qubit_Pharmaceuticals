This is the code we used for a hackaton organized in January 2025 by Margo, IBM and Qubit Pharmaceuticals.
During 48 hours, we had to predict the hERG toxicity of some molecules based on their smiles chain and other extracted molecular features.
We used GNN and transformers to encode a representation of the molecules and derive the toxicity.
